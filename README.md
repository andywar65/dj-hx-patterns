# dj-hx-patterns
Some patterns I use with Django and HTMX, Python 3.10 and Django 4.1
## Installation
If you are on Windows like me, copy the launch_dj_hx_patterns.ps1 to your computer, modify first three lines to your directory of choice and run the routine. I have pre-commit systemwide, if you are not interested delete the line.
